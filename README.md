## Below is the script for our presentation for Codefest, but it can also double as a short description.
We know our recycling system isn't perfect, but you don't need to feel like a waste of space for trying to recycle! Our software B.A.G.S which stands for Basic Artificial Garbage Sorter is designed to detect plastic bags to help with sorting recycling to prevent the loss of reusable materials. We're using OpenCV as our API and YOLO for object detection, writing our backend in Python.
